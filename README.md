## 🗺️ DSA Roadmap: Beginner to Advanced

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–3)

**Goal:** Build basic programming knowledge and understand what DSA is.

#### 📌 Topics:

* What is DSA and why it's important
* Time & Space Complexity (Big O Notation)
* Basic Input/Output in any language (Python, C++, or Java recommended)
* Variables, loops, conditions, functions

#### 📚 Resources:

* YouTube: CodeWithHarry (for Python/C++) or Apna College (for Java)
* Book: “Python for Everybody” or similar

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Basic Data Structures (Weeks 4–8)

**Goal:** Learn how data is stored and managed in memory.

#### 📌 Topics:

* **Arrays** (1D, 2D)
* **Strings** (basic operations, immutability)
* **Linked List** (Singly, Doubly)
* **Stacks & Queues** (using arrays & linked lists)
* **Hashing / HashMap / HashSet**

#### 💡 Practice:

* Easy problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [CodeStudio](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio)

#### 📚 Resources:

* NeetCode DSA Playlist (YouTube)
* GeeksforGeeks (for reading theory)

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Recursion & Backtracking (Weeks 9–11)

**Goal:** Learn recursive thinking and how to build solutions step by step.

#### 📌 Topics:

* Recursion basics
* Problems like factorial, fibonacci, permutations, subsets
* Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku, Maze problems

#### 💡 Practice:

* Solve recursive problems from LeetCode Medium

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Sorting & Searching (Weeks 12–13)

**Goal:** Understand how data is organized and retrieved.

#### 📌 Topics:

* Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort, Quick Sort
* Binary Search (with variations)

#### 📚 Resources:

* VisuAlgo (for visual sorting)
* Practice Binary Search questions on LeetCode

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Intermediate DSA (Weeks 14–18)

**Goal:** Build depth and confidence in solving real problems.

#### 📌 Topics:

* **Trees** (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
* **Graphs** (DFS, BFS, Weighted Graphs)
* **Heaps / Priority Queue**
* **Two Pointers, Sliding Window**
* **Greedy Algorithms**

#### 💡 Practice:

* 50 problems from LeetCode Easy-Medium
* Tree & Graph problems from NeetCode

---

### ✅ Phase 6: Dynamic Programming (Weeks 19–22)

**Goal:** Master the hardest but most important topic.

#### 📌 Topics:

* Memoization and Tabulation
* 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence
* DP on Strings, Arrays, Grids
* Bitmask DP (Advanced)

#### 💡 Practice:

* Solve 15–20 DP problems from LeetCode
* Use Striver’s DP Sheet (searchable)

---

### ✅ Phase 7: Advanced Topics (Weeks 23–26)

**Goal:** Learn techniques for competitive programming and coding interviews.

#### 📌 Topics:

* Tries
* Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees
* Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
* Advanced Graph (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, MST)

---

## 🔁 Revision & Practice (Ongoing)

* Daily 1–2 problems from LeetCode or Codeforces
* Revisit past problems after a gap of 1–2 weeks
* Participate in contests (LeetCode Weekly, Codeforces Div 3)
